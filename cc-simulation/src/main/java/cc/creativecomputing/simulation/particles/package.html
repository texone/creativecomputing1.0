Particle systems have long been recognized as an essential building block for detail-rich and lively visual environments. 
CPU based implementations can handle up to 50,000 particles. Another problem is to pass the data from the cpu to the gpu
for rendering.

<p>
This package provides a full GPU implementation of both the simulation and rendering of a dynamically-growing particle system. 
This implementation can render more than 1 million particles in real-time on recent hardware. It helps you to dramatically 
increase the level of detail and allows you to simulate much smaller particles. 
The massively parallel simulation of particle physics on a GPU can be a flexible combination of a multitude of motion and 
position operations, e.g. gravity, local forces and collision with primitive geometry shapes or texture-based height fields.
