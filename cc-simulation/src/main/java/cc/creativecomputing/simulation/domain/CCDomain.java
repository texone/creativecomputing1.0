/**
 * A Domain is a representation of a region of space. For example, the pSource action uses a 
 * domain to describe the volume in which a particle will be created. A random point within 
 * the domain is chosen as the initial position of the particle. The pAvoid, pSink and pBounce 
 * actions use domains to describe a volume in space for particles to steer around, die when 
 * they enter, or bounce off, respectively.
 * <br>
 * Domains are also used to describe velocities. Picture the velocity vector as having its tail 
 * at the origin and its tip being in the domain.
 * <br>
 * Finally, domains can be used to describe colors. For drawing with OpenGL, the full color 
 * space is 0.0 -> 1.0 in the red, green, and blue axes. For example, the domain PDLine, 
 * 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0 will choose points on a line between red and yellow. Points outside the 0.0 -> 1.0 
 * range will not be clamped, but eventually will be clamped deep within the OpenGL pipeline.
 * <br>
 * Since data from particle systems can be used by more than just the OpenGL renderer, the 
 * floating point triple used for color can mean different things to different consumers of 
 * the data. For example, if a software renderer used colors on the range 0 -> 255, the domain 
 * used to choose the colors can be on that range. The color space does not even need to be 
 * thought of as RGB, but will be for use in OpenGL.
 * <br>
 * Several types of domains can be specified. The two basic abstract operations on a domain 
 * are Generate, which returns a random point in the domain, and Within, which tells whether 
 * a given point is within the domain. Functions such as pSource that take a domain as an 
 * argument take it in the form of a PDomainEnum, followed by nine floats. The PDomainEnum 
 * is one of the symbolic finalants listed below, such as PDPoint. The nine floats mean 
 * different things for each type of domain, as described below. Not all domains require all 
 * nine floats. You only need to specify the first few values that are relevant to that domain 
 * type. The rest default to 0.0 and will be ignored.
