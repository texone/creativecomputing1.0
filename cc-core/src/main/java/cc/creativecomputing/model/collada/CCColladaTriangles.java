/**
 * Provides the information needed to for a mesh to bind vertex attributes together and then organize 
 * those vertices into individual triangles.
 * <p>
 * The <triangles> element declares the binding of geometric primitives and vertex attributes for a <mesh> element.
 * The vertex array information is supplied in distinct attribute arrays that are then indexed by the <triangles> element.
 * <p>
 * Each triangle described by the mesh has three vertices. The first triangle is formed from the first, second, and third 
 * vertices. The second triangle is formed from the fourth, fifth, and sixth vertices, and so on.
