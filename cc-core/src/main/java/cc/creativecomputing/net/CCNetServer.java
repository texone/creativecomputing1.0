 * This class dynamically groups together a {@linkplain CCNetIn} and a {@linkplain CCNetIn}, allowing bidirectional network communication from

 * automatically establishing child connections.
 * <P>
 * In <code>UDP</code> mode, simply one receiver and transmitter are handling all the communication. In <code>TCP</code>
 * mode, a {@linkplain SocketChannel} is set up to wait for incoming connection requests. Requests are satisfied
 * by opening a new receiver and transmitter for each connection.
