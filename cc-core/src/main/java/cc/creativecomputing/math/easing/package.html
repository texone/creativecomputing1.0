<p>Easing is acceleration, a change in speed. When an 
object is moving, it has a velocity of some magnitude. When the object is 
not moving, its velocity is zero. In the real world, velocity doesn’t suddenly 
jump from one value to another.</p>
<p>
This package and the contained classes are based on the easing code of
