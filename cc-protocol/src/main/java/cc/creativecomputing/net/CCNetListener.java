 * The {@linkplain CCNetListener} interface is used to register a client to a

 * message was received.
 * <p>
 * Note that these methods are typically called from the {@linkplain CCNetIn} thread
 * which is not the regular OPENGL thread. You may often want to
 * defer actual code to the event thread. You can do this by adding the received
 * messages to a list and invoking the actual code using
 * {@linkplain EventQueue#invokeLater(Runnable)}. This is particularly required when
 * dealing with render processes which require methods to be called in the event
 * thread.
