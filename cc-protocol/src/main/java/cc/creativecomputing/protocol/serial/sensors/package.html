The CCINPUT library allows creative computing to communicate with input devices like joysticks, 
joypads but also keyboards and mice. Using CCINPUT on MacOSX for example allows you to address 
more than one mouse. CCINPUT bases on a modified JInput version. To get access to the different 
devices it has to communicate with native libraries.
</p>
<p>
To use a device with CCINPUT you should ensure that it is properly installed first. Often a 
joystick has to be calibrated to work correctly. Use the printDevices() function to get a list 
of the available devices. There are two ways to use CCINPUT you can access an device and ask for 
the current state of its buttons and sliders and you can add listeners that handle the events of 
buttons.

<p>
CCINPUT is tested on Windows and MacOSX but should also work on Linux.
